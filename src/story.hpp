Others seek to join a trader's caravan as a guide or guard. The caravan lines are swelled by tall proud Judain slaves with their glittering black eyes, backs bent under casks of jewels, spices and silks. Those turned away from the caravans will drift at last to the seaweed-stinking waterfront to become rowers in the fleet and begin a life no better than slavery.\n\nIn your heart, you know that your destiny, the destiny of a Judain is greater than this. You knew this ever since the rabbi Caiaphas recognised the potential in you as a child and sent you to be instructed by the best the Judain could offer. He knew that you would accomplish great things. Now you are without peer among your people. One thing only you lack: a sense of purpose, a quest to show your greatness and put your skills to the test.\n\nThe city of Godorno is a stinking cess-pit. You find it hard to believe that once it was called 'The Jewel of the East'. In the past two centuries Godorno has become a byword for decadence, luxury and idle pleasure. Everywhere you look you see the insignia of the winged lion, once the proud standard of the city's legions. Now it stands as the very symbol of corruption and evil.\n\nYour people are rich, but the non-Judain of Godorno covet those riches \"Usurers, thieves,\"  they cry as your people walk the streets going about their daily business.\n\nThe Overlord stokes the fires of discontent. When those who speak out against his cruel reign disappear, never to be seen again, he blames the Judain. When people starve because he sells the harvest to the westerners for jewels, spices and silks, his minions say it is the Judain who profit from his peoples' wretchedness. Some Judain have retaliated. A group called the Sycaari has formed which inflicts acts of revenge upon the Overlord's followers. However, Caiaphas, your mentor is against this \"No good will come from meeting hatred with hatred,\" you once heard him tell you \"We must show our enemies how to live before the drag us all down into the depths of hate.\"\n\nCaiaphas has always urged the Judain to resolve things peacefully and to make connections with the non-Judain of the city, but the Overlord's insidious messages are too far reaching. Now the people hate you and all your kind. Soon it will not be safe to walk the streets.";

The boy is beneath notice. He sneers with his nose in the air, like the rich folk of the riverfront, but his sailcloth breeches are out at the knees. His father is probably a tanner or a tinker or some such.\n\nYour time in Godorno has taught you to ignore such insults.
